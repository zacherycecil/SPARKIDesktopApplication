# SPARKIDesktopApplication

## Welcome to the SPARKI Desktop application

## Create load and save profiles

## Debugging BlueTooth connection:
1. Go to Code button on this page (green button) and do download Zip
2. Unzip file and go to bin/Debug/SPARKIDesktopApplication.exe
3. Create profile -> Therapeutic -> Sync with SPARKI
4. The app will freeze for a sec then give you a list of local bluetooth devices. I need the BLE component address (idk how to find out which it is. It should print address next to name, but I assume the BLE component will not have a name.)
